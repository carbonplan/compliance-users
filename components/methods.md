## Methods

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) — the regulator in charge of implementing the cap-and-trade program — publishes a variety of cap-and-trade data. This tool connects the dots between three of CARB’s published data sources. Here we describe those sources.

[Compliance reports](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/cap-and-trade-program/cap-and-trade-program-data) are published at the end of each full (2013-2014, 2015-2017, and 2018-2020) and annual compliance periods (2021 and 2022) and detail how regulated entities comply with their cap-and-trade obligations, including through use of offset credits. We use the compliance reports to associate regulated entities (i.e. users) with offset project IDs and facility IDs.

[Mandatory GHG Reporting Data](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/mrr-data) (MRR) are published annually (2013-2022) and provide information on emitting facilities. Some of these emissions are “covered” by cap-and-trade, and therefore form the basis for a compliance obligation. We use the MRR data to connect facility IDs to facility names, types, and locations. A \*\* next to the name of a facility indicates a facility that appears in the MRR data, and is listed in the compliance reports, but in a different reporting period.

The [Offset Credit Issuance Table](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/cap-and-trade-program/cap-and-trade-program-data) provides information about the issuance of offset credits that are eligible for use in the cap-and-trade program. We use the Issuance Table to connect an offset project ID to project names, types, and locations.
