## Methods

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) — the regulator in charge of implementing the Cap-and-Trade program — publishes a variety of Cap-and-Trade data. This tool connects the dots between three of CARB’s published data sources. Here we describe those sources.

[Compliance reports](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/cap-and-trade-program/cap-and-trade-program-data) are published at the end of each compliance period (2013-2014, 2015-2017, and 2018-2020) and detail how regulated entities comply with their Cap & Trade Obligations, including through use of offset credits. We use the compliance reports to associate regulated entities (i.e. users) with offset project ids and facility ids.

[Mandatory GHG Reporting Data](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/mrr-data) (MRR) are published annually (2013-2020) and provide information on emitting facilities. Some of these emissions are “covered” by Cap-and-Trade, and therefore form the basis for a compliance obligation. We use the MRR data to connect facility ids to facility names, types, and locations. A \*\* next to the name of a facility indicates a facility that appears in the MRR data, and is listed in the compliance reports, but in a different reporting period.

The [Offset Credit Issuance Table](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/cap-and-trade-program/cap-and-trade-program-data) provides information about the issuance of offset credits that are eligible for use in the Cap & Trade program. We use the Issuance Table to connect an offset project id to project names, types, and locations.
