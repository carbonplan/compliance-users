## About

This tool is designed to make public Cap-and-Trade data about offset use more easily accessible. It connects the dots between various data sources, and makes it possible to answer questions about how offset projects, regulated entities, and emitting facilities are connected.

Specifically, the underlying data allows us to ask who has used credits from a particular offset project (project → users), which offset projects a particular regulated entity has turned in credits from (user → projects), and which emitting facilities are associated with a regulated entity (user → facilities). Note that while both offset projects and facilities can be connected to a user, the structure of the underlying data does not allow facilities and projects to be directly associated with each other.

Additional information about forest projects in particular — including total issuance and overlap with wildfire — can be found in our public [forest offsets project database](https://carbonplan.org/research/forest-offsets).
